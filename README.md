## About Me

I am Suhas Koushik, an engineering student with strong interest in analog electronics, circuit design, VLSI concepts, and simulation tools like LTspice. I actively work on understanding practical circuit behavior through laboratory experiments, analysis, and documentation.

## About this Repository

This repository contains my Linear Integrated Circuits (LIC) laboratory work carried out as part of my academic curriculum. It includes detailed LTspice simulations, circuit schematics, theoretical calculations, waveform analysis, observations, and final results for each experiment.

Each experiment is documented in a structured and technical manner to clearly explain:
- Objective of the experiment  
- Circuit design and implementation  
- Simulation procedure  
- Theoretical background  
- Output waveforms and analysis  
- Observations and conclusions  

The goal of maintaining this repository is to:
- Build strong fundamentals in analog circuit design  
- Maintain a professional record of lab work  
- Improve technical documentation skills  
- Use it as a reference for future academic and project work  

This repository reflects my hands-on learning and practical understanding of Linear Integrated Circuits and analog electronics.
