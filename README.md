## About Me

I am Suhas Koushik, an engineering student with a strong interest in analog electronics, circuit design, VLSI concepts, and embedded systems. I actively work on understanding real-time circuit behavior through simulations, laboratory experiments, and technical analysis using tools like LTspice and digital design environments.

My learning approach focuses on combining theoretical knowledge with practical implementation. I regularly perform circuit simulations, analyze waveforms, study device characteristics, and document results in a structured and technical format. I am particularly interested in Linear Integrated Circuits, transistor-based design, and electronic system development.

Through my academic work and lab experiments, I aim to strengthen my fundamentals in electronics, improve problem-solving skills, and build a solid technical portfolio. I maintain this repository to document my experiments, showcase my practical learning, and create a reference for future projects, research, and career opportunities in core electronics and VLSI domains.

## About this Repository

This repository contains my Linear Integrated Circuits (LIC) laboratory work carried out as part of my academic curriculum. It includes detailed LTspice simulations, circuit schematics, theoretical calculations, waveform analysis, observations, and final results for each experiment.

Each experiment is documented in a structured and technical manner to clearly explain:
- Objective of the experiment  
- Circuit design and implementation  
- Simulation procedure  
- Theoretical background  
- Output waveforms and analysis  
- Observations and conclusions  

The goal of maintaining this repository is to:
- Build strong fundamentals in analog circuit design  
- Maintain a professional record of lab work  
- Improve technical documentation skills  
- Use it as a reference for future academic and project work  

This repository reflects my hands-on learning and practical understanding of Linear Integrated Circuits and analog electronics.
